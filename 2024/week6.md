Hi all!

This week we'll talk hashing, passwords, and how C is really fast.

âœ… **Do Now! (Do one, some, or all!)**

- Watch two videos [using md5](https://youtu.be/xOYo2UdR7vE) and [reversing hashes for password cracking](https://youtu.be/VAG9DtdjwKw)
    - Code and references here: https://github.com/cse-summer-series/week6
- Read about [Input and Output in C](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C2-C_depth/IO.html) (some of the formatting stuff used in those videos) and [Converting Between Bases](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C4-Binary/conversion.html) (a reminder about hexadecimal for how the hashes are printed)
- Use what you learned to do the tasks described in the comments in the [Classroom Assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/OT50BXqg)
- If you haven't, fill out the [welcome form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0fj_yKUVfr6RbhSjB5K73AZ4CzQL8_3ZIa3LzIPLRYwBTgw/viewform):

ðŸ”— **Links and Resources**

- CSE PACE is a program for all incoming computing students (including 1st year transfer students!) to hang out, meet folks, get free lunch, and get mentoring from other students. It's also available for enrollment as CSE89 for a small amount of course credit (waitlist yoursel in a later pass, the enrollment is managed separately). The times for the fall will be Wed and Fri 12-1:30 (come to one or the other, not both). Information here: https://pace.ucsd.edu (times will be updated closer to the start of the quarter). Stop by when you have a chance in the fall!
