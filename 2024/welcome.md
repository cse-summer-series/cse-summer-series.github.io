Hi all!

If you're getting this email, I think you're an incoming UCSD CSE transfer
student this fall. Welcome!

üëãüèª **CSE Summer Series**

My name is Joe, I'm a professor in the CSE department. I teach several lower
division courses (you may end up taking CSE29 with me in the fall!).

I'm writing to tell you about the CSE Summer Series, a free online summer
program run by the department.

I'll be reaching out with weekly emails, and we'll be providing a bunch of
different resources:

- A Discord chat server for saying hi and asking me (and each other) questions
- A weekly activity (usually programming) for reviewing content useful for the
  upcoming year
- Videos, readings, and websites related to (and in some cases straight from)
our courses to help you prepare for the year
- Reminders about summer events and opportunities
