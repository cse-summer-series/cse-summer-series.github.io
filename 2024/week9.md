Hi all!

Happy September! üçÇ

The quarter is right around the corner though with our quarter schedule it's not here just yet (class starts in 3 weeks!).

For the remaining weeks I'm not planning as many *new* programming challenges, instead I'm going back and making some solution videos for past challenges.
I encourage you to discuss these problems on Discord, or email me with questions about them (I've replied to a few emailed/DMed questions, discussion is fine, too!)

‚úÖ **Do Now! (Do one, some, or all!)**

- Watch the video [Arbitrary-Length Password Cracking](https://youtu.be/M-RtTrrIGY4)
    - Code here: https://github.com/cse-summer-series/week6/blob/solution/passwd_crack.c
- If you're interested in pushing the performance of the password cracking tool, read about [Optimizations](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C12-CodeOpt/index.html). What's the longest password you can crack in under a minute?
- If you haven't, fill out the [welcome form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0fj_yKUVfr6RbhSjB5K73AZ4CzQL8_3ZIa3LzIPLRYwBTgw/viewform):
