Hi all!

This week we'll talk about memory leaks, free(), valgrind, and learn more about memory!

âœ… **Do Now! (Do one, some, or all!)**

- Watch two videos [memory leaks](https://youtu.be/wK75Eic4e_w) and [valgrind](https://youtu.be/GT5pJKi29xs)
    - Code and references here: https://github.com/cse-summer-series/week4
- Read about [Debugging Memory with Valgrind](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C3-C_debug/valgrind.html#_debugging_memory_with_valgrind)
- Use what you learn from that to complete the [programming task for the week](https://classroom.github.com/a/Fn-jHno4)
- If you haven't, fill out the [welcome form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0fj_yKUVfr6RbhSjB5K73AZ4CzQL8_3ZIa3LzIPLRYwBTgw/viewform):

- Did you know there are *Transfer Peer Coaches* who have office hours you can attend? Book a virtual or in-person appointment with [a transfer peer coach](https://transferstudents.ucsd.edu/peer-coaching/coaches/index.html) (I'm not affilliated with the program but it seems super cool and I saw open slots on their calendars!)
