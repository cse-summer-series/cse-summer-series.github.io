## CSE Summer Series

My name is Joe, I'm a professor in the CSE department. I teach several lower
division courses (you may end up taking CSE29 with me in the fall!).

I'm writing to tell you about the CSE Summer Series, a free online summer
program run by the department.

I'll be reaching out with weekly emails, and we'll be providing a bunch of
different resources.
