## CSE Summer Series

This is the page for the CSE Summer Series, a free online summer program run by
the CSE department at UCSD. This page and materials are maintained by [Joe
Politz](https://jpolitz.github.io)

I'll be reaching out with weekly emails, and we'll be providing a bunch of
different resources.
