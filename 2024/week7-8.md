Hi all!

I'm back from vacation (the reason for no update last week!).  This week we'll
talk about a simple Web server and URLs.

âœ… **Do Now! (Do one, some, or all!)**

- Watch the video [A Simple Web Server]](https://youtu.be/oe9mlcNuSbI)
    - Code and references here: https://github.com/cse-summer-series/week7
- Read about [Compiling and Linking](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C2-C_depth/advanced_libraries.html) [Writing and Using Your Own C Libraries](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C2-C_depth/advanced_writing_libraries.html) (I've been doing something really hacky and simple for our examples, that chapter discusses a better approach)
- Use what you learned to do the tasks described in the comments in the [Classroom Assignment](https://classroom.github.com/a/7PtyZev5)
- If you haven't, fill out the [welcome form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0fj_yKUVfr6RbhSjB5K73AZ4CzQL8_3ZIa3LzIPLRYwBTgw/viewform):
