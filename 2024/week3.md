Hi all!

We'll continue our exploration of UTF-8 with dynamic memory allocation!

‚úÖ **Do Now! (Do one, some, or all!)**

- Watch two videos [Implementing `bytes_for`](https://youtu.be/8_Dcz8AxKro) and [UTF8 Substring](https://youtu.be/zkjy14KyTFA) that follow up on last week's assignment
    - Code and references here: https://github.com/cse-summer-series/week3
- Read about [Pointers and Functions](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C2-C_depth/pointers_functions.html) and [Dynamic Memory](https://diveintosystems.org/book/C2-C_depth/dynamic_memory.html) in Dive Into Systems
- Use what you learn from that to complete the [programming task for the week](https://classroom.github.com/a/fwucLl5w)
- If you haven't, fill out the [welcome form](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc0fj_yKUVfr6RbhSjB5K73AZ4CzQL8_3ZIa3LzIPLRYwBTgw/viewform):
